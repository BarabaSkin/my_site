         <div class="me">Hello everyone. My name is Nikolai, I'm from Russia and I'm a programmer. I have had experience with languages such as Python, C++, C#, Pascal, JavaScript, as well as experience in website development for a year.  My interest in programming began with my dad's classes. The interest in web development was born by itself, after which I began to study this area in various ways. I had a great opportunity to be a codemasters student, which I'm not going to miss.  I set big goals and I'm going to achieve them.</div>
